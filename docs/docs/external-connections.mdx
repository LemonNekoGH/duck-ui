:::warning Alpha Feature
This external connection feature is currently in **alpha stage** and is provided as a proof of concept. It is still under active development and may undergo significant changes. Not recommended for production use.
:::

## Quick Start

The fastest way to test experiment with external connections is to use the provided demo credentials:

You can create your own connection @ https://demo.duckui.com/connections

```bash
Name: EXAMPLE (Or any name you prefer)
Host: https://quackpy.fly.dev
Port: 443
Database: - (leave empty)
User: duckui
Password: duckui
```

## Connection Methods

### Method 1: Docker Environment Variables

```bash
docker run -p 5522:5522 \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_NAME="EXAMPLE" \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_HOST="https://quackpy.fly.dev" \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_PORT=443 \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_USER="" \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_PASS="" \
    -e DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_DATABASE_NAME="" \
    -e DUCK_UI_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_EXTENSIONS="true"
```

:::note
- DUCK_UI_EXTERNAL_HOST: Currently, only Quackpy - That's running http_server extension under the hood is available as a provider
- USER/PASS: Any values can be used to create credentials
- DATABASE_NAME: Not required for this implementation (leave empty)
- DUCK_UI_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_EXTENSIONS: Set to "true" if you need to use unsigned DuckDB extensions
:::

### Method 2: User Interface

You can create connections directly through the Duck-UI interface:

1. Navigate to Connections page
2. Click "Add Connection"
3. Fill in the connection details
4. Test and save your connection

## Important Disclaimers

### Production Use Warning
This feature is not intended for production use or storing sensitive data. Use at your own risk and only with non-sensitive, test data.

### Security Considerations
- Connection credentials are stored in local storage
- Communication may not be encrypted depending on server configuration
- No built-in protection against SQL injection
- Basic authentication implementation
- Use in trusted environments only

### Technical Requirements
The external server must support:
- HTTP Basic Authentication
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- POST requests with query parameters
- ClickHouse JSON/JSONCompact response format

### Current Limitations
- Limited error handling
- Basic authentication only
- Network-dependent performance
- Incomplete schema information
- Limited DuckDB feature support
- No built-in security protections

## Testing the Connection

1. Use the provided demo credentials
2. Test basic queries to verify connectivity
3. Explore available databases and tables
4. Note any performance or functionality limitations

:::caution
Remember this is an alpha feature. Functionality may be limited or change without notice.
